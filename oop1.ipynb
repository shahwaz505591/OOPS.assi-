    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on representing the essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows you to create a simplified model of an object or system in code, focusing only on the relevant attributes and behaviors. The main purpose of abstraction is to provide a clear and concise interface for interacting with objects, without exposing the internal complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the example of a \"Car\" class. A car has various attributes like make, model, color, and methods like start(), stop(), accelerate(), and brake(). Abstraction in this context would involve creating a class that hides the inner workings of these methods and provides a simple interface to interact with the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, color):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.is_running = False\n",

    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        self.is_running = True\n",
    "        print(\"Car started.\")\n",

    "    def accelerate(self):\n",

    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two essential concepts in OOP, but they serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on showing only the relevant and essential characteristics of an object, while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "It simplifies the representation of objects, making them easier to understand and use.\n",
    "Abstraction is achieved by defining abstract classes and interfaces, which can contain abstract methods without providing any implementation.\n",
    "The abstract methods serve as a contract, and the concrete subclasses must implement them.\n",
    "It helps to manage complexity by dividing a system into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    In the Car class example above, the methods start(), stop(), accelerate(), and brake() provide an abstraction of how a car can be operated, without exposing the internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation focuses on bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).\n",
    "It provides data hiding, meaning that the internal state (attributes) of an object is not directly accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "Access to the attributes is controlled through getter and setter methods, allowing data validation and protection.\n",
    "Encapsulation helps to maintain the integrity of an object's state and behavior, preventing external interference.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    In the Car class example, the attributes make, model, color, and is_running are encapsulated within the class. They can only be accessed or modified using getter and setter methods."

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    The abc module stands for \"Abstract Base Classes\" in Python. It provides the infrastructure to create abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and typically contains one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation). Abstract classes serve as blueprints for other classes, and their main purpose is to define a common interface that concrete subclasses must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module provides the ABC (Abstract Base Class) and abstractmethod decorators, which allow you to define abstract classes and abstract methods, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reasons to use the abc module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce a common interface: By creating abstract classes, you can ensure that all subclasses implement certain methods, providing consistency across the hierarchy.\n",
    "To provide a template for subclassing: Abstract classes can define common methods and attributes that can be reused and extended by concrete subclasses."

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Data abstraction is a technique used to expose only the relevant attributes and behaviors of an object while hiding its implementation details. In Python, you can achieve data abstraction through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define an abstract class: Create an abstract class using the ABC metaclass from the abc module. Inside the abstract class, you can define abstract methods using the abstractmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclass the abstract class: Create concrete subclasses that inherit from the abstract class. These subclasses must implement all the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create objects using concrete subclasses: Instantiate objects from the concrete subclasses. These objects will have the attributes and methods defined in the abstract class, providing a clear and consistent interface.\n",
